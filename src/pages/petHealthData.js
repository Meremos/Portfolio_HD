            In large-scale projects, it's sometimes challenging to determine where and how to start. Fortunately, "Design Thinking" comes to our aid. With this methodology, I created the "UX Road Map," serving as a reference for the entire team and providing a solid foundation for our decisions. Initially, understanding the motivations of veterinarians was crucial, followed by those of pet owners, which proved to be quite distinct.

to group "Post-its" into families that represented the content of the site.</p>
<p>The written topics were based on the workshops conducted with stakeholders, as well as the data collected during user interviews. Participants from both sides then had to assemble the topics into groups and assign a name to each group. Experience showed that Pet owners could classify the topics into groups quite well, but had difficulty naming certain groups, especially those related to medical prevention.</p>
