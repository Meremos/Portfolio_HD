        <p>An adoption model in marketing refers to a framework or theory that explains how and why consumers adopt new products or innovations. These models typically outline the stages or processes through which individuals progress when deciding to adopt a new product</p>
        <p><strong>How to discover the key adoption factors</strong> related to innovative products to ensure an acceptable and usable product for users. This is what this research is based on in order to highlight factors such as:</p>

        <p className='bullet2'>How does the use of innovation impact consumer well-being and satisfaction?</p>

        <p>I won't go into the details of the analysis that was produced; however, here are some important points. </p> 
        <p className='bullet'>Consumer attitude towards innovation has a strong influence on adoption. A consumer with a positive attitude will facilitate the adoption of innovation.</p>
        <p className='bullet'>We have also been able to confirm the strong influence of usage intention on innovation adoption.</p>
        <p className='bullet3'>Regarding usage, we found that 2 out of 3 people have adopted the innovation studied, and 1 out of 4 people do not use the product. The data allowed us to observe that buyers adopt more than renters.</p>
        <p>This study has allowed me to confirm my intuition that <strong>perception is a key attribute of the adoption</strong> or acceptance of a new technology. Indeed, a product perceived as complicated will decrease its adoption.</p>

        <p>Sketching in design is like brainstorming with a pencil and paper. <strong>It's quick, flexible, and helps you explore ideas visually without getting bogged down by digital tools</strong>. You can sketch out different concepts, refine details on the fly, and easily share your ideas with others. It's not just about drawing—it's about sparking creativity, collaborating effectively, and ultimately, coming up with innovative solutions faster. Sketching early in the process allows you to iterate quickly, ensuring that everyone is on the same page before diving into more detailed designs. It's a powerful tool that enhances creativity, speeds up decision-making, and leads to better user experiences.</p>
